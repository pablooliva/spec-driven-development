## 5. Update Progress File for Phase Transition

Update `SDD/prompts/context-management/progress.md` with planning completion and implementation handoff:

```markdown
## Planning Phase - COMPLETE

### Specification Finalized
- Document: `SDD/requirements/SPEC-[###]-[feature-name].md`
- Completion timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- Stakeholder approvals: [List teams that approved]
- Implementation ready: YES

### Key Decisions Made
- [Major architectural decision]
- [Technology choice with rationale]
- [Trade-off decision made]

### Research Foundation Applied
- Production issues addressed: [Count]
- Edge cases specified: [Count]
- Test scenarios defined: [Count]

## Implementation Phase - READY TO START

### Implementation Priorities
1. [First component/feature to implement]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Critical Implementation Notes
- [Key technical decision from spec]
- [Important constraint to remember]
- [Subagent delegation opportunity]

### Context Management Strategy

```

## 6. Final Checklist Before Completion

Before marking the planning phase as complete:

- [ ] Specification document fully populated (no TODOs or placeholders)
- [ ] All stakeholder reviews completed or explicitly waived
- [ ] Implementation readiness verified
- [ ] Progress file updated with transition information
- [ ] Quality verification passed
- [ ] Implementation priorities clearly defined

## Context Management Reminders

If context is becoming high during completion:

### Delegate to Subagents

Use these subagents (via Task tool) as needed:

1. **Explore subagent** (`subagent_type=Explore`)
   - Use for: Finding additional files or patterns
   - Example: Verifying integration points or configuration files
   - When to use: If you need to locate specific files referenced in the specification

2. **General-purpose subagent** (`subagent_type=general-purpose`)
   - Use for: Researching best practices or architectural patterns
   - Example tasks:
     - "Research industry standards for [pattern] implementation"
     - "Find similar implementations in the codebase"
     - "Analyze security considerations for [feature type]"
   - When to use: When you need to validate architectural decisions or research alternatives

### What Must Stay in Main Context

- Core specification decisions
- Stakeholder feedback and approvals
- Critical implementation guidance
- Risk assessments

## Phase Transition

Planning phase is now COMPLETE.

The specification in `SDD/requirements/SPEC-[###]-[feature-name].md` provides comprehensive guidance for implementation.

Next Claude Code session should:

1. Start fresh with Claude Sonnet
2. Run `/sdd-implementation-start` to begin coding
3. Reference the specification for all implementation decisions
